### Installation
The installation is something pretty important for me because of my computer's memory. Therefore I had to get rid of some stuff I considered as 'not strictly necessary', among these items were:
- Stylus preprocessor
- Prettier
- Husky

I know prettier help us with the code, but it is not a big deal for the app to work properly, so...

```
npm install
```

### Execution
I have worked in some React projects before and I have some experience with components, pages and router. The way how the project is organized is pretty straight forward. Among the essential directories we have:
- assets: Only icons were used in this project
- components: The Layout works as a template. It is useful to gather all the components that will be in all the pages. In this case, the Header and the ProfileIntro are included in all the pages
- containers: We only have App, which works as the router
- pages: All the pages for this project, included the NotFound one, althought the latest doesn't have any special design
- styles: Separated into two sections, one for components and other for pages. All was done with plain css

```
npm run start
```

### Server
It was no any major problem with this 'fake API', it works nice and my app renders all the data just fine. I wanted to add a loader, but I think it was no so-necessary because the page mantains statics almost always...

```
npm run server
```

### Compilar
No problem at all

```
npm run build
```

### Pruebas Unitarias
```
npm run test
```

### ESlint
```
npm run lint
```
